# Code-Plagiarism-Checker
This is a plagiarism detection application designed specifically for programming code. The application searches publicly available resources in the form of databases of github.com and stackoverflow.com websites. It is highly user-customisable and offers two separate searching algorithms, a slow, precise line search algorithm and a much faster, slightly less precise modular algorithm. It supports most common programming languages and achieves searching speed of 20-25 lines/modules per minute. Requires constant, stable internet connection and login credentials for both websites as it uses their internal search engines. User is able to read and analyse search results in a form of an interactive report, stating which lines have been marked as plagiarism, what is the overall plagiarism percentage and which online sources have been used the most. During testing the application has achieved quite high, although not optimal efficacy, in some cases not recognising partial plagiarism, however non-plagiarism code has always been marked as such. Line search algorithm has demonstrated slightly higher effectiveness than modular, at a cost of a disproportionally higher search times.
